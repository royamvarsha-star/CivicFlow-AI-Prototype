## Project Overview

AI for Natural Language Understanding and Classification
Where AI is Used: At the initial point of input, when a citizen enters a complaint in natural language (text).
How AI is Used (Allowed Components):
Prompt Engineering and Entity Extraction and Summarization are used to process the raw complaint.
The AI will classify the complaint into predefined categories (e.g., Road Maintenance, Sanitation, Public Policy Query, Water Supply).
It will summarize the core issue, extracting key entities like location, time, and urgency level.
2. AI for Instant Reply (Information Retrieval and Answering Doubts)
Where AI is Used: When the complaint or "doubt" is a common question or relates to existing public information.
How AI is Used (Allowed Components):
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is utilized against a knowledge base of official documents (e.g., municipal FAQs, policy documents).
The AI performs Information Retrieval to generate a contextual, immediate, and accurate answer to solve the doubt without requiring official intervention.
3. AI for Automated Routing and Decision-Making Support
Where AI is Used: After the complaint has been classified and summarized, to ensure it reaches the correct authority efficiently.
How AI is Used (Allowed Components):
Agentic AI Workflows are implemented to automate the routing process.
The AI uses Decision-making support logic based on the classification (e.g., if "Road Maintenance," forward to the Public Works department) to send the summarized complaint directly to the responsible official for faster action.
